I don't do very impressive stuff here. Mainly just me goobing around with random C++ stuff.
Sometimes I watch tutorials, sometimes I try to make some trash on my own. Don't expect much.

Little asked questions: (l.a.q)
Q:  why the silly username, are you an idiot?
A:  Yes I am an idiot. My first online username was "Speedy" on deeeep.io, very generic, I know. I was 7. Then, when I wanted to sign up for Scratch, I needed a username...
    Guess what, Speedy was taken! I asked myself: What do I do all day... That's how this silly username came to be.
Q:  What do you hope to accomplish?
A:  chances to get a decent future by doing something I remotely like doing.
Q:  What is your favorite project you made?
A:  I made a mandelbrot renderer that never worked. Amazing.
